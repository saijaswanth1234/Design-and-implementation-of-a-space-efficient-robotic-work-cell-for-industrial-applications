# Design and implementation of a space-efficient robotic workcell for industrial applications

This repository contains all the CAD designs, STL models, and Structured Text (ST) code developed for my master's thesis at Hochschule Schmalkalden, as well as a demonstration video of the robotic workcell in action. The project involves building a compact robotic workcell for automated pick-and-place operations using a Pilz PRBT6 robot, a Schunk electric gripper, and a conveyor system, all coordinated through a Berghof B-Nimis industrial controller.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project description

This thesis demonstrates how a space-constrained robotic workcell can be engineered with mechanical precision and software modularity. It focuses on:

- Implementing a pick-and-place sequence using a Pilz PRBT6 robotic arm
- Gripping objects of varying widths using a Schunk EGP 40 electric gripper with custom-designed fingers
- Detecting workpieces using a proximity sensor mounted with a custom 3D-printed holder
- Coordinating conveyor and gripper logic via Structured Text programming in CoDeSys on a Berghof B-Nimis controller
- Using a state-machine-driven control architecture for safety, accuracy, and modularity

All parts were modeled in SolidWorks and some were 3D printed for actual deployment and testing.

## üíª Code overview

The `coding/` folder contains selected parts of the CoDeSys program used to control the robot, gripper, and conveyor system. These files are written in Structured Text (ST) and structured using modular, state-machine-driven logic.

Included files:
- `Example_Pick_EGP.st`: Main program structured around a state machine
- `FB_MoveToTargetPosition.st`: Function block for coordinated robot movement
- `ST_WorkpiecePlacement.typ`: Custom data type for managing positional memory

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> To make this code functional, you must configure the correct hardware setup in CoDeSys, including:
> - Adding all required `Axis Function Blocks` for each robot axis
> - Setting up the correct device tree with controller, EtherCAT devices, and I/O modules
> - Mapping variables to actual hardware or simulation targets  
>
> The full project file is **not shared** publicly due to confidentiality, as it contains sensitive configuration and controller-specific details. Only key logic files are included for educational reference.
