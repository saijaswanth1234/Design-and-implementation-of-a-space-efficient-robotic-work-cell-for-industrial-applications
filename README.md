# Design and Implementation of a space-efficient robotic workcell for Industrial Applications

This repository contains all the engineering design of custom components and code files developed to fullfill a pick and place task using a 6-axis robot PRBT6. The project involves the integration of robotics, workcell automation using a Bnimis controller and CoDeSys. The complete system was designed, modeled, and simulated using both CAD tools (Solidworks) and structured PLC programming environments (CoDeSys).
